Made a scrolling div to house pizza combinations generated by JS

Moved sizeSwitcher function (lines 404 to 415 in main.js) and changeSliderLabel function (lines 419 to 433 in main.js) out of larger resizePizza function.
By moving these two functions, they were made to have global scope and only have to be called once instead of each time the the resizePizza function is called. In the case of the changeSliderLabel function, document.querySelector is a relatively slow way of transversing the DOM, so only having to call it once greatly speeds up the resizing process.

Along those same lines, I replaced querySelector and querySelectorAll wherever I could with the more specific method of getElementById. You can see this in the variable used to append all of the pizzas when the page loads (line 470 of the main.js file) and in the variable used to generate the moving background (line 536 of the main.js file). In addition, I changed querySelectorAll to getElementsByClassName on line 438.

Simplified the changePizzaSizes function and also moved it out of the resizePizza function. I brought the two variables out of the loop in order to minimize the number of times they were declared. The variable randomPizzaContainer was made global scope (line 438), and the variable newwidth was taken outside of the for-loop (line 445).

Wherever a variable could be moved outside of a loop, I did so.

.transform performs better than .left, so I changed it within the updatePositions function (line 516).

Finally, I changed how the number of background pizzas is established. Instead of being set at a fixed number, I made it so the background was based on the window size. This avoids unnecessary rendering.
